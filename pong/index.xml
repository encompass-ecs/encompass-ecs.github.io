      <description>Everyone has played, or at least heard of, Pong. Right? Right&amp;hellip;
Pong was one of the first video games ever created and as such, it is extremely simple. We&amp;rsquo;re introducing a lot of new concepts with Encompass and the Hyper ECS architecture, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good choice to try re-implementing this game in Encompass as an example.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be developing this with the Encompass/LOVE starter pack. Go ahead and set that up if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already so you can follow along.</description>
