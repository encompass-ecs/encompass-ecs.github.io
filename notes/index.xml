      <description>Special thanks is due to Mark Kollasch for his insight into the n-pass engine structure and for overall excellent architecture feedback. Many of the ideas in this project were given to me by him.
Thanks to Seiji Tanaka for writing a state machine system with me many years ago and sending me on a long journey of thinking about game architecture.
Thanks to Mitch Gerrard for doing a bunch of graph theory problems with me.</description>
